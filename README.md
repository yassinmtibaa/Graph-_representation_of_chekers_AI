# Checkers AI - Graph Theory Project

This project is a Checkers AI implemented in Python, designed as a graph theory project. The AI is developed to predict and respond to the opponent's moves, aiming to create an unbeatable game experience. The game board and moves are represented using graph concepts, and the AI is powered by the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning.

## Project Overview

- **Graph Representation**: The checkers board is modeled as a graph, with nodes representing positions and edges representing valid moves.
- **AI Algorithm**: The AI uses Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning to evaluate possible moves up to a specified depth, making decisions that maximize its chance of winning.
- **Goal**: Develop an interactive AI that can play checkers at a high level, impressing with its strategy and unbeatable moves.

## Features

- Basic checkers game mechanics, including piece movement, captures, and king promotions.
- A smart AI opponent that predicts and counteracts player moves.
- Easy-to-read, expandable codebase for adding more complex AI features, such as reinforcement learning or neural networks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** is required.
- Install dependencies (optional for `numpy` if used for board representation):

  ```bash
  pip install numpy
